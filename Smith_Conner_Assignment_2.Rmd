Agricultural water is managed by irrigation districts and is increasingly scarce. To conserve water and reduce costs, four irrigation districts are considering developing a water market, in which water rights would be traded across the districts. In this homework you will conduct data analysis, simulations, and policy analysis to help inform the development of the water market.

## **Analysis** {.tabset}

The dataset contains estimates of the marginal cost of reducing water use in each of the four irrigation districts (Kern, Mojave, Antelope, and Ventura) for different levels of reduction (in Acre Feet).

Current (i.e. baseline) water use in these districts is: 
- Kern = 150 AF
- Mojave = 140 AF
- Antelope = 220 AF 
- Ventura = 245 AF

Prices are in $/Acre Foot and quantities are in Acre Feet (AF).


### **1. Abatement Costs**

For each irrigation district, plot the marginal abatement cost data (from the data provided) and estimate a linear regression model with zero intercept. These estimated linear regressions will be your estimates of the marginal abatement cost curve (one for each irrigation district), which you will use for the remainder of this analysis.

#### **MC Across Counties**
```{r}
districts_sub <- districts %>% 
  rename(kern = mc_kern,
         mojave = mc_mojave,
         antelope = mc_antelope,
         ventura = mc_ventura) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(kern, mojave, antelope, ventura),
               names_to = 'county',
               values_to = 'mc')

ggplot(data = districts_sub, aes(x = reduction, y = mc)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = county)) +
  scale_color_manual("County", 
                     values = c('cadetblue3', 'darkgoldenrod1',
                     'darkolivegreen4', 'sienna2')) +
  labs(x = "Reduction (AF)", y = "Marginal Cost ($/AF)")

# Linear model for Kern MC forcing 0 intercept 

lm_kern <- lm(mc_kern ~ 0 + reduction, data = districts)
extract_eq(model = lm_kern, use_coefs = TRUE)

# Linear model for Mojave MC forcing 0 intercept 

lm_mojave <- lm(mc_mojave ~ 0 + reduction, data = districts)
extract_eq(model = lm_mojave, use_coefs = TRUE)

# Linear model for Antelope MC forcing 0 intercept 

lm_antelope <- lm(mc_antelope ~ 0 + reduction, data = districts)
extract_eq(model = lm_antelope, use_coefs = TRUE)

# Linear model for Ventura MC forcing 0 intercept 

lm_ventura <- lm(mc_ventura ~ 0 + reduction, data = districts)
extract_eq(model = lm_ventura, use_coefs = TRUE)

```


### **2. Demand Assessment**

```{r}
# Make a predict data set from the linear models 

kern_predict <- predict(lm_kern)
mojave_predict <- predict(lm_mojave)
antelope_predict <- predict(lm_antelope)
ventura_predict <- predict(lm_ventura)

districts_predict <- data.frame(districts, kern_predict, mojave_predict, antelope_predict, ventura_predict)

# Now clean this like before 

districts_predict_clean <- districts_predict %>% 
  select(-mc_kern, -mc_mojave, -mc_antelope, -mc_ventura) %>% 
  rename(kern = kern_predict,
         mojave = mojave_predict,
         antelope = antelope_predict,
         ventura = ventura_predict) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(kern, mojave, antelope, ventura),
               names_to = 'county',
               values_to = 'mc')

# This will be the new MC data set 
  
```

Using your estimated marginal abatement cost curves, derive each district’s demand curve for water. In other words, how much would each district be willing to pay for the right to use the first AF of water, second AF, etc.? Plot each district’s demand curve on a single graph. Which sector is willing to pay the most for the first AF of water?

### **Figure X**

```{r}
# Caluclate demand curves:
# Kern (Baseline = 150) --> 2.29(A) 
## 2.29(150 - A) --> 343.5 - 2.29A

# Mojave (Baseline = 140) --> 3.8(A)
## 3.8(140 - A) --> 532 - 3.8A

# Antelope (Baseline = 220) --> 2.86(A)
## 2.86(220 - A) --> 629.2 - 2.86A

# Ventura (Baseline = 245) --> 1.78(A)
## 1.78(245 - A) --> 436.1 - 1.78A

           label = "Kern Demand", angle = -22) +
  geom_abline(color = "darkolivegreen4",
              intercept = 532, slope= -lm_mojave$coefficients) +

           label = "Mojave Demand", angle = -30) +

              intercept = 629.2, slope= -lm_antelope$coefficients) +
  annotate("text", x = 50, y = 520, 
           label = "Antelope Demand", angle = -25) +
  geom_abline(color = "sienna2",
              intercept = 436.1, slope= -lm_ventura$coefficients) +
  annotate("text", x = 10, y = 440, 
           label = "Ventura Demand", angle = -19) +
  labs(x = "Reduction (AF)", y = "Marginal Cost ($/AF)")

```
#### *This graph shows both water demand (downward sloping lines) and marginal cost of abatement (upward sloping lines), color coded for each county.*  

Based on the graph above, Antelope County is willing to pay the most for the first unit of water. 

### **3. Policy Considerations**

Here you will analyze three alternative policies for reducing water use among these irrigation districts. In total, these irrigation districts will need to reduce water consumption from the current 755 AF down to 500 AF. 

### **Cap Without Trade**

```{r}
# Cap without trade. Reduce each district’s water use by the same fraction (e.g., 1/3 of current baseline use), so the 500 AF target is met. (multiplier is 0.338)

fraction <- 0.338
kern_cap <- 150*fraction
#50.7
mojave_cap <- 140*fraction 
#47.32
antelope_cap <- 220*fraction
#74.36
ventura_cap <- 245*fraction
#82.81

# DON'T KNOW ABOUT STRINGENCY HERE, Is stringency just 0.338? 

# Cost, plug in reduction to each district's cost curve, then take the area under the marginal cost curve for each at the given price/quantity reduction? 

kern_price <- kern_cap*(lm_kern$coefficients)
kern_cost <- 0.5*kern_price*kern_cap

mojave_price <- mojave_cap*(lm_mojave$coefficients)
mojave_cost <- 0.5*mojave_price*mojave_cap

antelope_price <- antelope_cap*(lm_antelope$coefficients)
antelope_cost <- 0.5*antelope_cap*antelope_price

ventura_price <- ventura_cap*(lm_ventura$coefficients)
ventura_cost <- 0.5*ventura_cap*ventura_price

total_cost = ventura_cost + kern_cost + antelope_cost + mojave_cost
```

*(1)* Stringency of this policy is defined as the magnitude of the fraction for reduction. In this case, that is equal to `r fraction`. 

*(2)* Total cost of this approach is $`r total_cost`.

*(3)* Individual district costs are as follows:
- Kern : $`r kern_cost`
- Mojave: $`r mojave_cost`
- Antelope: $`r antelope_cost`
- Ventura: $`r ventura_cost`

*(4)* This policy does not generate tax revenue.

Antelope COunty bears the highest individual cost as a result of this cap without trade policy which applies an equal fractional reduction to the baseline water use in each district. 

### **Tax on Water Use**


### **4. Drought Sensitivity**

A severe drought hits California, and it is necessary to reduce water use from 500 AF down to 300 AF. Your job is to estimate the cost of the drought (i.e., the cost of reducing water use from 500 AF to 300 AF) to each irrigation district under each policy. Considering the entire jump from status quo (755 AF) to the drought (300 AF), which policy is preferred by each irrigation district? How does your answer depend on 
how rights are allocated to each district (in policies (a) and (c))
